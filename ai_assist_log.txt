AI Assist Log:
1. I used ChatGPT to understand the assignment and break it into step-by-step parts.
2. ChatGPT helped me write the basic structure for analyze_logs.py and scrape_summarize.py.
3. I asked ChatGPT to explain errors, like fixing the "_name_" issue and how to activate the virtual environment.
4. I used ChatGPT to guide me on how to make index.html to display my scrape_summary.csv data.
5. I edited all code manually after understanding what each part does.
6. I used ChatGPT to help me write the reflection.txt and README.md files.

All final scripts were tested and verified by me before submission.
